The one thing that I liked most about this book is the writing style. It's so subtle, neurotic pleasing, and sarcastic. This book has probably the best climax I have ever read till now. It is shame that I watched martian before reading the book. The world that the author built with primitive biology, physics, chemistry concepts is over the roof. There is no complicated scientific jargon where you have to rub your head against a rock. Ofc I didn't get my head around time dilation.

It makes sense to master the tools that you spend the most time with. And Chrome sits on top of that list. Here are some of them 
1. Ctrl + Shift + A -> search for both open and recently closed tabs, useful when you've 50 tabs across 5 different windows 
2. Naming your windows -> so that every window has some purpose 
3. Grouping the tabs -> for reducing the visual load if a window has too many tabs to fit in a screen 
4. Integrating search engines -> no brainer if you search the websites directly, a very handy feature. (I'm baffled that Chrome has this feature as it's the antithesis of their advertising manifesto)

The silliest problem that poses threat to your finances is the gym subscription problem. Whether you take an annual or monthly membership , we all can agree that most of that goes down the river. We might comfortable say that gym owners are next to government employees in the way they earn. I know what you have been thinking. Just bill the amount of days you visit the gym.

But I think you should step back a little bit and ponder over this.  Subsidizing other humans is not new, throughout your whole life you have been subsidizing some parts of others life. The most complicated financial instrument runs on this simple principle (insurance). Maybe in the future you get treated in a fancy hospital with money from your health insurance friends. And maybe you also paid for your friend while you're studying. If we think deeply, we might also say that the billing should be done on the amount of time you spent with the equipment. Probably this problem can be compared to OTT subscriptions. If your friend, who is a movie buff, consumes 80 hrs of content per week whereas you consume merely 20 hrs. Will your friend agree to pay more than you ? Probably not because you can’t gauge the films. If that’s the case then you should be willing to pay more for blockbuster films.

Maybe then it's the right time to talk about this. Until then sayonara.

The medium by which you get modelled (the brain’s perception of different things) changes with every passing generation. Earlier it was an essay now it is a blog. 
At their core, Words have the same power as they had at the beginning of human civilisation. And technology updates the representational medium of those Words now and then. 

Your core opinions are formed through the transfusion of other people’s Words with your thoughts and experiences. And due to this fact, Twitter has a good chance of shaping your opinions than either Instagram or Linkedin. Governments and Politicians use Twitter to exploit its superpower to various degrees. 

Blogs hold the same regard as Tweets for shaping your opinions, if not more. There is a reason why Developer focussed SaaS companies are hiring good content writers to ship their copy, product narrative is a feature in itself which can be advantageous in a competitive market(most developer tools rarely differ from others).

Lately, I have realized that Interfaces matter more than their Implementations. Key distinctions in Interfaces can give you a competitive edge like no other. Yet people get lost in the Implementation details. The Interface is the design and design requires effort. 

The Interface is the gateway to whatever-the-thing you're building and I feel like not enough work is being put into shaping that gateway. Jumping over the gun and discussing the details is fine, but they should be driven by Interfaces. Finally, the Interface is the agenda that acts as a direction.

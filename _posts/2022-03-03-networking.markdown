There is a lot of buzz around to network like hell with all the people around you and this is based on the premise that networking yields better opportunities in the future. And as a matter of fact, it is true. India's ascension to the space program is simply the by-product of networking. If it isn't for Vikram Sarabhai's network, India Space Program wouldn't be in its current form. It was Sarabhai's contacts around the world who helped India in the nascent stages of its space program. 

What people miss out in the above example is that Sarabhai held a core competency in the domain of physics. In the kindest of terms, if you start networking with people (random introductions) without holding a strong foot on anything, you are just an intermediary and don't hold any significance.  Rather build a knowledge repertoire that can attract and help people.

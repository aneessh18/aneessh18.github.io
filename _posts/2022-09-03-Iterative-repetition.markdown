Repetition is a very peculiar term in the English language, as its contextual dependence is damn high. For me, my mind always repelled at the idea of Repetition of anything. But lately, I have been appreciating Repetition a lot, especially Iterative Repetition.  

People think Repetition is boring and is a dead end when it interferes with your career. And I agree with the latter, you can’t just assume that you’ll climb up the career ladder with repeating things day in and day out. But Iterative Repetition is a game changing way to model your career. 

Iterative Repetition is repeating things over in a different set of environments. This means that you gain different insights and perspectives over a period of time until you’ve mastered the domain of that thing you’re repeating all along, post which you got to replicate this phenomenon with a different thing.

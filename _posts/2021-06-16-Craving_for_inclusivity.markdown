For the past year, many of my thoughts and actions have been majorly towards one goal. That is for inclusion. Never have I felt this much urge to feel included. I go to a specific subreddit to find tribes that radiate my vibes. Even in the programming languages or frameworks, I yearn to be are the result of their communities. I am even learning a new language just to understand the system programming streams of youtuber. 

This enormous feeling of inclusion when added with obsessiveness and shiny object syndrome is a perfect recipe for disaster. You get sucked into a vicious cycle wheel that is propelled by anxiety. To feel inclusive of some group the exploration for your tribe begins. Normally when you know internally the vibe you want to search then within no time a discord server or subreddit will be found. But if it is outbound(that means you don’t know your vibe yet) then most probably all our thoughts will be plagued by shiny object syndrome. When this happens you fall prey to the abundance of the internet. You try to fit into a tribe by cultivating their culture. 

This is fine if you’re going after a few niches. But remember you are still trying to fit and if by chance (most probably) you get hit with another tribe that oozes swag then you’re doomed. This causes you to run on a treadmill that has an infinite power supply. And FOMO helps in expanding the list of tribes and this induces anxiety (the baap). Once anxiety enters the game there is little chance for escape. It further deepens the misery and the needle barely moves. The progress of oneself will be a distant dream. The only answer which has some remedy to this excruciating cyclic process is minimalism.

When I joined the workforce right out of college I was expecting to do only one thing. And that was to code. Eventually, I realised that coding is one of the many things I am supposed to do.  Matter of fact is that there are boring parts of my job and I don't remember signing up for them. 

Writing emails, communicating with the stakeholders, and painfully making sure that your colleagues understand your style of working are some of the parts that constitute the boring parts. Even though I understood the significance of those activities, I still have a hard time accepting them. Diabolically it is because of those boring parts, I value the time that I spend to code. 

If I were looking at any job profile, the first thing I would do is research the boring parts of it and ask myself whether I am ready for those activities, cause they constitute 90% of the things that you're supposed to do. 
 

The list of mundane things that I do regularly
1. Reviewing obvious code of my peers 
2. Standups, where I will have to communicate my progress 
3. Writing emails that don't require intellectual effort. 
4. Monitoring the services and fixing them when they're down for the most obvious reasons. 
5. Providing support for the services that you haven't designed. 
6. Being helpless when you don't have the power to prioritise meaningful things

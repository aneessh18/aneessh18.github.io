There is something about meditation that produces an indescribable experience. To weed out the constant noise around meditation is the way forward. There are mainly 2 phases which the practitioner goes through while meditating. The first one is Distillation and the latter phase is Nirvana.

In Distillation your brain gets bombarded with a constant stream of thoughts and your eyes hesitate to close. This is the most difficult phase as the brain is resistant and does not want to confront those thoughts. Mostly this phase gets over within 20 mins. And what comes hereafter is a purely blissful experience.

Nirvana is attained when you donâ€™t remember the last thought that hit you. Forgetting everything becomes the most sought out feature in Nirvana. Even though noise can permeate through your brain, it does not recognize or allocate resources for the incoming signals. They just hit the cerebrum and get dropped off.

Enduring the first phase bears the fruit in Nirvana.

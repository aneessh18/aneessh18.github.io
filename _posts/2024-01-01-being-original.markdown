![being-original](images/being-orginal.png)

I abandoned some of my projects because they weren't original enough. I was trying too hard to create something original until I realised that it was a foolish ambition. There might be a few number of people who can create something original from their very first step. Even by then they have slogged enough to exhaust all the mundane ideas that surfaced in their head. But from the vast swaths of the human population greatness/novelty/originality is more of an iterative process where you exhaust all the bad ideas (obviously with optimisations) until you start hitting with the good ones.  

The only goal I have this year is to be a newer version of myself. A fresh perspective.

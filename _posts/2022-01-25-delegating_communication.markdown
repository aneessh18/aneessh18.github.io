More often than not, you've hit the dead-end of trying to explain a system/convey-your-opinions to a person who has neither shared culture nor experience w.r.t you. I didn't notice this strange phenomenon that was playing out in my career ventures. You see all this while, up until my under-graduation, I was always out with somebody with whom I shared something in the cultural aspect. But now, I am left alone in the Sub-sahara African desert with nothing but shared technical vocabulary(which itself manifests in different forms).

Sure you can pull up all the technical words from Wikipedia to explain the systematic working of a microservice and a monolith, but have tried the battle-tested do doing the aforementioned thing using shared-lingo to a friend. Yeah, nothing beats that. That is what I call true optimization and evolution in human behavior.

I mean why blabber over something in 15 min call when can you just express the same emotion in emojis and memes(which are superior most of the time).

Injecting new vernaculars between 2 different communicating entities (to trade) is akin to building a bridge between two islands that trade something for a living. You are effectively improving the quality of life of all the merchants on both islands. Remember bullet trains are far more superior and economical than cargo ships to transfer the goods. And once you build the bridge, the countries achieve an equilibrium state which neither of them wants to leave.

Back to my point, the whole notion of team bonding exercises in a corporate setup is to build a shared sense of vocabulary which in turn translates to shipping products at higher velocity. So indeed, there is some validation to my idea.

Therefore, we should strive to achieve this shared equilibrium with our fellow Homo Sapiens by not intruding on their privacy totally.

I was triggered to write this post when I was having a conversation with my friend, where he replied "Reading too many Kunal Shah's Tweets ?" to my question of "Common let's write a substack to build our distribution" (a reference to Kunal's "Jiska Distribution, Uski Bhais").

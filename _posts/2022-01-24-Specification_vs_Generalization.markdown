Crack this nut, and boom you're on top of the corporate career ladder and way above your peers. Of course, it doesn't merely apply in the narrow use case of professional life but also in the grand scheme of things of the universe as well, the life.

It's not that easy to acquire this skill though, i.e Switching between Specialization and Abstraction. You need to adopt a lot of reading-the-room kinda strategies to pull this off, which is harder given the context of Pandemic enforced Zoom meetings. Feeding of the subtle clues that our fellow human beings toss off in the air and switching gears isn't everybody's cup of tea. The initial attempts may resemble throwing darts in a pitch black room insulated from sunrays. 

Ok enough of the abstract explaination of this mystic concept. Let's get into details. Say you're a engineer managing a group of freshly minted college grads working on delivering a product to the stakeholder. Imagine a situation where you've to give a demo to the stakeholder and collect feedback which should essentially distill into Jira's, bits and electrons so that the mercenaries can start working? That kinda of stuff I am talking here.  

Given the normalistic distribution of every possible human skill, more often that you would piss exactly 1 of the 2 groups, either the mercenaries or the visionaries(stakeholders, com'on). Piss off the visionaries, that extra raise is sure not coming from here. Piss off the mercenaries, your project is as good as dead. 

So, this is where you should take some inspiration from the Maestro(the musical orchaestrator). Communicating with the Musicians in the vernaculars of the music and hope that comes off pleasant to the ears of audience.

People often think of coding as an extension of writing and even the discourse on the internet agrees with this notion and I don't agree with this notion. Let me explain why. Creative writing, which is the one often talked about and respected, happens when you consciously flex your creative muscles and start exploring the thought space. The tool you employ to materialize your thoughts in words is the natural language, which has a diverse set of features(metaphors, irony...). There is no structure you've to adhere to and if you're skilled enough you can even create space for ambiguity in writing. 

Whereas in coding the tool you employ is a language which has been stripped off of ambiguity. And also the thought space is very limited and effectively you're dictating a deterministic system. So the claim that coding is an extension of writing and being a good coder translates to good writer is a bogus one. 

The last thing, the tools and interfaces one uses to explore the possibilities will ultimately dictate the journey and destination.

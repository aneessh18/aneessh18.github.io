For the vast majority of the art that gets produced, there is little value for it when it enters a different phase of time. Though fewer in number, there are artists that capture the core constructs of human civilization and produce art around it. 

Books that reveal the atomic constructs of the way things are built, never go out of fashion. 
In the lieu of this realisation, I started reading books that are not publicised in the current news hype cycle. Keeping my news information diet to a minimum along with reading classics from the past has ensured my sanity prevails. Step-function breakthroughs are only possible when the units in the time dimension get zoomed out. But only upon careful inspection, you will get to know that the mosaic was actually formed by arranging smaller pieces together. 

I find the New Yorker to be much more information-dense than any other news outlet. I suspect it will have to do with the production frequency of their content. Instead of publishing pieces that are still unravelling, NewYorker has a sufficient amount of time to contemplate. With the time factor on their side, their content has a much larger shelf-life.

Many people mistake knowing a bunch of jargon as competence. In some cases, it might even suggest otherwise. It doesn't matter if you know the most esoteric programming language in the world if you can't get the damn job done. 

People usually look down upon Mercenaries(who get the job done). Though Visionaries are tainted as the Hero of Ages and hailed for their Visions(obviously), most of them fall into the con-artist category. There are good odds that you'll be rich(not filthily) by being a Mercenary. 

I respect Acquired Jargon(which somebody has obtained from being in the trenches by doing something). But I despise Superficially acquired jargon(memorizing a bunch of stuff). The problem with Superficially Acquired Jargon is that there is hollowness underlying beneath it. And trained people can easily sniff out the hallow people. 

Most people are Visionaries since birth. But without being a Mercenary they fail to become a true ones.

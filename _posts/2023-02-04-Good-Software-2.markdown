This list maily comprises of the libraries and frameworks I use frequently 

1. Guice (hard to grok initially, but it is worth)
2. Dropwizard (was a pioneer in the Java ecosystem and I still admire the constructs it invented)
3. Spring and Spring-Boot (love the convenience)
4. Redis 
5. Guava (very utilitarian)
6. Kafka (suitable for enterprise but would not be my first preference)
7. Maven (simplest dependency management tool, I wish something like it existed in Python Ecosystem)
8. FailSafe and OkHttp
9. Morphia (half decent when compared to its counterparts)
10. Webpack and TS.

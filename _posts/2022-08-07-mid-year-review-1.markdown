- **Should have been more aggressive in the start while I was being onboarded to my first job**. Took more than a month to get the whole picture of the internal tooling and abstractions. Should have found out someone who was willing to help me understand the internals of the company.
- **Was not comfortable asking people for help as I was afraid of getting no from them**. But it turns out to be a bad assumption to make in the first place. People are willing to help, you just need to find out a good time. 
- **Should have set out personal 1-1's with all my teammates in the beginning itself**.  
- **Should have been more proactive with the follow-ups w.r.t to an Issue or an MR**. 
- **Context is everything**. There were some instances where the effort I put in without realizing the context had gone futile. Could have saved a ton of unnecessary work. 
- **Became lazy with documentation after a while**. Initially, I was very enthusiastic about documentation, but I lost interest after a while. Big mistake on my part. Documentation is the most important skill that can reduce the repeated effort, lubricate and delegate communication in an effective manner. 
- **Was unsure about the priorities of many tasks**. I am getting better at managing tasks with differing priorities. 
- **Didn't time box my day-to-day tasks**. Huge mistake. Everytime task has to be time boxed, you can't keep dragging it till you can.
- **Didn't think reading existing code was a good idea**. Again a huge mistake. Code and Tests are the best documentation of the codebase. Getting comfortable reading code is paramount to debugging. 
- **Learning is exponential when you're on Support**. The kinda of skills that get acquired when you're on Support helps you to be more than a programmer. Communication, Delegation, Prioritization, Debugging, How-not-to-write-code and what not. 
- **Was not a good code-reviewer at the beginning**. Was thinking too much about design patterns and other idealistic shit. Instead, could have focussed on common-sense and instincts. Any code should meet basic readability and making-sense aspects.  
- **Should have googled more about any unknowns I was encountering on day-to-day basis**. Basic googling infuses much more context than anything will.  
- **Didn't respect the human aspects that arise from code**. I didn't care much about the backward compatibility and constraints of various surrounding systems. Used to propose audacious things which have 0 percent of materialization. One word, was not realistic enough. 
- **Didn't experiment enough and didn't invest enough time in mastering the fundamental tech**.  Having code samples which can help you to play with things and mastering CLI tools can massively come to your aide when the situation arises. Gotta work on this more. **Hands on experience beats everything**.   
- **Didn't pay much heed to my curiosities**. Again a big mistake. Whether it is making small POCs and understand how they work or reading some good'ol research papers, you have to follow your curiosities.

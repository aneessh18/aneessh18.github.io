Hi ðŸ‘‹, this is Aneesh. I am a programmer who dabbles in various aspects of computer science. I like to know how things work under the hood and re-create small parts of good old projects. 

Currently,  I am learning about functional programming, primarily about LISP dialects. 

In my leisure time, I read books that spawn literature and science fiction. As of now, Haruki Murakami is my favourite author.  I am also a Podcast Junkie ðŸ™‚.
